# medical_appointment

#### warning ⚠️: this is a school project

## How is ts works?
This is a simple schedule for medical appointment, you can pass the name of you doctor <br>
then the day and hour that you want.
After that the programam asks what is the doctor's specialization, than it's done. You also can<br> say that you want another appoitment.
It's simple, just to understand how classes and inheritance in java. Next time I will implement more methods and functionality.
