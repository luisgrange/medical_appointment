# medical_appointment

#### warning ⚠️: this is a school project

## How is ts works?
This is a simple schedule for medical appointment, you can pass the name of you doctor <br>
then the day and hour that you want.
After that the programam asks what is the doctor's specialization, than it's done. You also can<br> say that you want another appoitment.
It's simple, just to understand how classes and inheritance in java. Next time I will implement more methods and functionality. 

## Why build that?
Well, as I said before, I did it because of my college, was an exam... <br> I think, the best way to learn a new technology is build something 
and why not share that? Maybe can help other students that is struggling with classes and inheritance!
